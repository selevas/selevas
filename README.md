## About Me

Hey, my name's Benjamin! I'm a full stack developer with strong experience in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, and NodeJS, as well as some experience with Python, React.js, Flutter/Dart, and PHP.

Several years ago I did a lot of web development for clients, but all the sites have since disappeared or changed dramatically.

Most of my recent professional experience has been writing internal tools and apps for my employers. However, I'm working on developing more open source code to share my work!

### My plans

I'm currently improving my skills with TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, and various other technologies. I'm in the process of refactoring [an old demo exercise](https://github.com/selevas/bridge-crossing) I did several years back into TypeScript and React, as well as working on another demo web app to showcase my abilities. They can be found here in my GitHub profile as they continue to be developed.

My objectives are to continue developing my skills in ways that allow me to contribute to projects and find work at interesting companies.

### Other facts about me

Although I was born and raised in the United States, I moved to Ecuador ten years ago and have been living here ever since. It is my intention and desire to work remotely for companies everywhere in the world, although primarily those in the western hemisphere.

In addition to programming, I have several interests including piano, novels, baking, and writing. I dabble from time to time in graphic design as well.
